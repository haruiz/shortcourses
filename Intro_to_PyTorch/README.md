# PyTorch
This PyTorch short course will introduce the basics of deep learning with PyTorch, an open source machine learning library developed primarily by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). The basic concepts of deep learning methods will be covered, and PyTorch will be introduced with examples.

PyTorch is an open source machine learning library developed primarily by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It is based on the Torch library and used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. PyTorch provides tensor computing that could be accelerated with GPUs and TPUs and deep neural networks on a tape-based autodiff system. (wikipedia.org).
